== Description of files/directories

* learn_xgboost_param_search.py - python script that iteratively trains a gradient boosting model with different parameter configurations. Also performs hyperparameter search using cross validation.

* learn_xgboost_rand_param_search.py - same as above, but using randomized hyperparameter search using cross validation.

* learn_neural_network.py - trains a neural network model, and asks for user input (from stdin) for different parameter configuration.

* learn_svm.py - same as above but using the SVM model.

* ./original_data - stores original training/test data. This also contains lightweight train data just for testing script.

* ./output - stores log data from xgboost_param_search.py. Also contains the labeled output generated by test_ensemble_xgboost.py

* test_ensemble_xgboost.py - reads the full training data and trains an xgboost model using hard-coded parameters. We obtained these parameters from learn*.py script. Uses a set of xgboost models.

* test_xgboost.py - reads the full training data and trains an xgboost model using hard-coded parameters. We obtained these parameters from learn*.py script. Uses one xgboost model.

== How to run script

python learn_xgboost_param.search.py - performs training/parameter.

python learn_xgboost_param.search.py light - performs training/parameter search over a light training data set.

python test_ensemble_xgboost.py - trains a model using the full training data, and generates labelled test data.


== Environment

These scripts were developed on Python 2.7 with the following libraries :

* scikit-learn-0.18.dev0 (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/support.html#documentation-resources)

* SMOTE (https://github.com/fmfn/UnbalancedDataset)

* xgboost (https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/tree/master/python-package)
